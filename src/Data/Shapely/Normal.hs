module Data.Shapely.Normal (
{- |
Functions for composing and modifying our 'Normal' form types.

These take their names from the familiar functions in Data.List and Prelude,
but are given more general forms, sometimes loosely after the constructions in
Edward Kmett's "categories" package. There are probably many improvements and
additions possible here. 

You probably want to import this in one of the following ways:

> import Data.Shapely.Normal as Sh
> import qualified Data.Shapely.Normal as Sh
> import Data.Shapely.Normal hiding ((!!),repeat,replicate,concat,reverse, map, length)

/NOTE/: The structure of the classes, type functions, and class constraints
here are likely to change a lot.

-- TODO:
--
--   v0.2:
--      - move to closed type families, look at replacing OverlappingInstances
--        with these by using families for type equality
--          - use closed type fams in proxy-kindness too
--          - does this give us some injectivity / better inferrence yet?
--              (WON'T. apparently work not being done on this yet)
--      - in class declarations, consider removing constraints (but keeping
--         them on instances) this will help clean up signatures on polymorphic
--         functions. This will probably be more efficient more of the time too.
--      - work on PatternFunctor stuff (see branch) now that we have closed TFs
--      - use some scheme to close type classes (maybe closed type fams will help)
--      - freeze 'massage' behavior
--      - support inlining, and "templates" defining structure. Have NormalR use this
--      - maybe: 
--          - type-indexed 'factor' (and maybe 'distrivbute'), maybe two variants:
--              - automatically factors out all common terms (regardless of position)
--              - factors out specifically-requested terms (regardless of position
--          - incorporate TypeNat stuff (for specifying length and constructor number)
--
--    sometime:
--      - constraint kinds: hmmm...
--          can we somehow use this for predicate classes (we'd like that for Functor)
--            (allows constraints to be indexed by types...)
--          we should be able to do this with closed type families where a
--          nested (f source) (f target) evaluates to a Functor constraint, else ()
--          ...at least we can simplify constraints
--      - study "lens", and see how we can integrate/defer functionality to that lib
--          - also look at "vinyl"
--      - maybe an nthMap function on Sums
--      - Do we have nice inference on closed type families yet? revisit constraints
--      - function that does a series expansion (up to _nth) of a recursive type
--      - read up about "row types"
--      - see if where and if we can make interesting use of DataKinds
--          - replacing didactic classes with "kindly-typed" structures?
--      - read "Small induction recursion..." paper
--      - check out "multirec" approach to recursive structure, and http://mainisusuallyafunction.blogspot.com/2010/12/type-level-fix-and-generic-folds.html
--      - consider some scheme (from proxy-kindness) for optionally "guarding"
--         ambiguous/polymorphic terms coming from parameterized types in
--         functions that make use of type equality (e.g. massage)
--
-- OTHER FUNCTIONS:
--   
--   - straighten :: e.g. ((a,b),(c,(d,e))) -> (a,(b,(c,(d,(e,()))))) -- requires closed type family (or overlapping instances)
--   - factor & distribute, (+ type-indexed variants)
--   - a recursive, monoid-style `zipWith` (i.e. an `mappend` that does something useful recursively)?
--
--   taking a numeric arg (implement with sum/product "templates"/peano numbers)
--     - length type func. (with type nats?)
--     - splitAt  (product take/drop in terms of this)
--     - popi (or factori?). product (!!) in terms of this
--
--   complex, maybe not useful:
--     - intersperse
--     - intercalate
--     - transpose
--
--   products only: (USEFUL; DO LATER)
--     - zips ... e.g.:  zip ( (1,(2,())) , ( (True,(False,())) ,  ( ('a',('b'('c',()))) , ()))) == ....
--         but should we (can we) deal with differing-length prods like zip?  ... type Zipped () (a,b) = () , Zipped (a,b) () = () , Zipped (a,bs) (x,ys) = ( (a,(x,())) , Zipped bs ys) ...or for prods of prods we probably will be wanting a fold on products... oy
--         note also: above should be named "transpose"
--     Homogeneous only:
--       - and, or, sum, product, maximum, minimum, folds (NO: toList is sufficient for all of these folds)
--       - maps, scans
--       - sort/insert ?
